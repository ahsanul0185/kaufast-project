Real Estate Web App Development Roadmap 
Build a real estate web application based on the features and development process detailed in the provided document.
Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
Define Project Scope & Technologies:
Goal: Real estate web app (like zillow) with the modern design.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React (using Vite)
Backend: Express.js (Node.js)
Database: PostgreSQL (potentially with PostGIS)
Authentication: standard email/password
Styling: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
Mapping: Leaflet, react-leaflet
Real-time: WebSockets
AI: OpenAI, Anthropic (optional, for advanced features)
ORM/Query Builder: Drizzle ORM (implied)
React-router-dom
Database Setup (PostgreSQL):
Set up a PostgreSQL database instance 
Define initial database schemas using Drizzle ORM (or chosen tool):
users: Include fields for id, username, password (hashed), email, full_name, role (enum: 'user', 'agent', 'admin'), subscription_tier (enum: 'free', 'premium', 'enterprise'), preferred_language.
properties: Include fields for id, title, description, price, address, city, state, zip_code, country, latitude, longitude, bedrooms, bathrooms, square_feet, lot_size, property_type (enum), features (jsonb), images (jsonb array of URLs), owner_id (FK to users), is_premium (boolean), listing_type (enum: 'buy', 'rent', 'sell'), neighborhood_id (FK).
neighborhoods: Include fields for id, name, city, state, zip_code, latitude, longitude, scores (overall, safety, schools, transit, etc.), median_home_price, etc. (Expand as needed).
favorites: user_id (FK), property_id (FK).
messages: id, sender_id (FK), receiver_id (FK), property_id (FK, optional), content, created_at.
(Later phases add tables for: property_tours, chat_analytics, etc.)
Implement database connection logic (server/db.ts).
Create a storage interface (IStorage) and implementation (DatabaseStorage in server/storage.ts) for database operations.
Run initial database migrations (drizzle-kit push or similar).
Basic Backend Setup (Express):
Set up the main server entry point (server/index.ts).
Configure essential middleware (JSON body parsing, CORS if needed, session management if using).
Establish basic API routing structure (server/routes.ts).
Basic Frontend Setup (React/Vite):
Configure Vite (vite.config.js).
Set up Tailwind CSS (tailwind.config.ts, index.css).
Create main application files (client/src/main.tsx, client/src/App.tsx).
Implement client-side routing 
Create core layout components: Navbar.tsx, Footer.tsx.
Set up React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for data fetching and caching (client/src/lib/queryClient.ts).


Phase 2: Core Features - Property Listings & Management
Property Data & Display:
Refine properties schema based on required display fields.
Develop PropertyCard component for listings. Handle layout variations, image placeholders, action buttons (Save, Compare, Share), and visual tags (Featured, Premium).
Develop PropertyDetailsPage. Display all property info, image gallery/carousel, map integration, description, features list. Use Tabs for organization. Include action buttons.
Develop HomePage with Hero section (background image, headline, search bar) and Featured Properties section (displaying cards).
Property Management (Dashboard):
Create PropertiesManagement component for Agent/Admin dashboards.
Implement functionality: View user's properties, Add New Property, Edit Property, Delete Property.
Develop comprehensive AddPropertyForm / EditPropertyForm.
Include all fields from the properties schema.
Integrate PropertyLocationPicker component (using Leaflet map with draw tools) to replace manual latitude/longitude inputs.
Implement backend API endpoints for property CRUD operations, including authorization checks (user can only manage their own properties, unless admin).
Implement logic for marking properties as "Premium" (potentially tied to subscription).
Favorites System:
Add "Save" (heart icon) button to PropertyCard and PropertyDetailsPage.
Implement useFavorites hook or similar state management for favorite status.
Create backend API endpoints (POST /api/user/favorites, DELETE /api/user/favorites/:propertyId) to manage entries in the favorites table. Validate input.
Update button UI based on favorite status (filled/unfilled heart). Fetch initial favorite status on component load.
Create "My Favorites" section in the User Dashboard.
Phase 3: Search & Mapping
Search Filters & UI:
Implement main search bar (Hero section) for location input.
Develop comprehensive SearchFilters component. Include inputs/controls for:
Listing Type (Tabs: Buy/Rent/Sell).
Property Type (Dropdown).
Price Range (Slider or Min/Max).
Beds/Baths (Dropdowns/Buttons).
Area (SqM - Min/Max).
Lot Size (Min/Max).
Year Built (Min/Max).
Features (Checkboxes).
Implement "Advanced Search" / "More Filters" collapsible section. Add context-specific "Apply Filters" button.
Update shared Zod schema (searchPropertiesSchema) for validation.
Search Backend & Results:
Enhance backend search API (/api/properties/search) to handle all filter parameters, including spatial queries (Phase 4.4).
Develop SearchResultsPage. Fetch and display results based on query parameters from URL. Use PropertyCard components. Implement view options (Grid, List, Map).
Display active filters as removable badges. Update URL on filter changes.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
Map Integration (Leaflet):
Integrate react-leaflet for map displays.
Show properties as markers on the map view of search results. Customize marker appearance (price, icon). Style map controls.
Implement interactive map tooltips on marker hover.
Spatial Search (PostGIS):
Ensure PostGIS extension is enabled in PostgreSQL.
Add geometry column (type geometry(POINT, 4326)) to properties table.
Create database trigger to auto-populate geometry from latitude/longitude.
Add GIST index on geometry.
Update backend storage (searchProperties method) to use ST_DWithin for radius searches based on latitude, longitude, radius input parameters.
Update search API and frontend filters to support radius search input.
Phase 4: Advanced Features & User Experience
UI/UX Enhancements:
Implement engaging "Bubble" notifications (Framer Motion) via a custom hook/provider.
Enhance Property Sharing: Create PropertyShare component with social media links/copy functionality, integrate into details page.
Make a quicl add property pop up audio enabled.
Add draft fetaire

Phase 5: AI-Powered Features (Optional)
AI Service Setup:
Get OpenAI/Anthropic API keys (store in Replit Secrets).
Install SDKs. Create backend utility modules (server/openai.ts, server/anthropic.ts) with API call logic and error handling.
AI Recommendation Engine (OpenAI):
Backend: Track user activity (searches, views, favorites). Generate user preference profiles. Implement recommendation logic (property matching based on profile). Create API endpoint.
Frontend: Develop RecommendedProperties component. Integrate into relevant pages. Consider adding "Match Score".




Phase 6: Premium Features & Final Touches
Bulk Property Upload (Premium):
Backend: Develop API endpoint (/api/properties/bulk-upload) to parse CSV/Excel, validate, and insert properties. Handle multi-image URLs (pipe-separated). Protect with premium subscription check.
Frontend: Create BulkUploadPage (premium access only). Add file input, template/example downloads, help text, processing feedback.
Advanced Analytics Dashboard (Owners/Agents):
Expand existing analytics components. Add owner-specific KPIs (views, inquiries, tours). Implement visualizations, market trends, filtering. Restrict access appropriately.
Final Styling & Branding:
Ensure UI consistency (colors like graphite/dark blue, fonts, spacing).
Update branding elements (logo, company name "InmobiÂ®", footer).
Conduct thorough cross-browser and responsive testing.
Phase 7: Core Features - Authentication & User Management
Standard Authentication:
Develop authentication UI: Login and Registration pages/forms (client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx). Use UI library components (e.g., Shadcn UI).
Implement backend API endpoints for register, login, logout (/api/register, /api/login, /api/logout). Create frontend authentication context/hook (client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx) managing user state, loading, errors, and providing login, register, logout functions. Wrap the app in an AuthProvider.
Implement form validation (client-side and server-side using Zod schemas defined in shared/schema.ts).
Address potential initialization/context/dependency issues during development.

User Roles & Dashboards:
Implement role-based protected routes (client/src/lib/protected-route.tsx) checking user role from auth context.
Create distinct dashboard pages (UserDashboard, AgentDashboard, AdminDashboard).
Develop corresponding sidebar components (UserSidebar, AgentSidebar, AdminSidebar) with role-specific navigation links. Apply distinct styling if desired.
Create placeholder components for dashboard sections (User: Profile, Favorites, Messages; Agent: Property Listings, Profile; Admin: User Management, Settings, Approvals).
Phase 8: Deployment & Maintenance
Error Handling & Monitoring: Implement comprehensive error handling (try/catch, user-friendly messages). Utilize Replit monitoring or external tools. Practice defensive coding.
Maintenance: Plan for updates, bug fixes, dependency management, backups.
